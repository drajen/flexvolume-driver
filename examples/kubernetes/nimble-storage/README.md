**Storage Class Properties**

A storage class is used to create or clone an HPE Nimble Storage-backed persistent volume.  It can also be used to import an existing HPE Nimble Storage volume or clone of a snapshot into the Kubernetes cluster.  The parameters are grouped below by workflow.

Available storage class properties can be found on [InfoSight](https://infosight.hpe.com/InfoSight/media/cms/active/pubs_Linux_Integration_Guide_NLT_2_4_1.whz/fzg1518196727387.html).
